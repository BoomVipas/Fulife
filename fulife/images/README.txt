You need to create the following images:

1. CEO_fullbody.png - A full body image of the CEO character
2. map.png - A game map background image
3. player_sprite.png - A sprite sheet for the player character with animations for up, down, left, and right movement

Since these are binary files, they can't be created directly through a text editor. Please use an image editor to create these files or copy them from your assets folder.

For a placeholder:
- CEO_fullbody.png should be at least 50x70 pixels
- map.png should be 800x600 pixels
- player_sprite.png should be a sprite sheet with 3 columns (frames) and 4 rows (directions)

The quest4.html file has been created successfully and is looking for these images.
