This directory should contain sound files for the game.

Suggested sound files:
1. background_music.mp3 - Background music for the game
2. dialog_sound.mp3 - Sound that plays when dialog appears
3. walk_sound.mp3 - Sound that plays when the player moves
4. interact_sound.mp3 - Sound that plays when interacting with NPCs

Since these are binary files, they can't be created directly through a text editor. Please use a sound editor to create these files or copy them from your assets folder.
